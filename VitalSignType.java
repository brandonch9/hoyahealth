/**
 * NEWS (National Early Warning Score) â€“: 
 * The NEWS is a standardised physiological assessment tool, designed to monitor and track 
 * acutely and critically ill patients, which enforces the necessity of early escalation and 
 * clinical review. The NEWS is based on a simple scoring system in which a score is allocated
 *  to physiological measurements already undertaken when patients present to, or are being
 *  monitored in hospital.
 * Six simple physiological parameters form the basis of the NEWS scoring system: 
 * respiratory rate,
 * oxygen saturations, 
 * temperature, 
 * systolic blood pressure, 
 * pulse rate and 
 * level of consciousness
 * Body Tempature
 * Urine Output, an output of less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour for 2consecutive hours 
 * is a marker of renal hypoperfusion and should trigger assessment and further action
 * Height BMI (body mass index) evaluation BMI>25 -->A1,A2 adn A3\
 * Weight
 * Pulse Rate (A pulse rate measurement value range 60<pulseRate<100
 * BloodPressure (systolic) DP value<70 and SP value<100mmHg
 * BloodPressure(diastoic) DBValue>90 and SP value>140 mmHg
 * BlokPresure (MAP) DB>120 mmHg
 * SpO2 SpO2 <90%
 * FEV1 Testing with sprometry determines the presence and severity of the airw obstruction.
 * configure alarm FEV1<80% COPD SLIGHT
 * Glucose a glucose value of of this range will trigger an alarm glucose<80 or glucose >126 mgDl
*  respiratory rate
*   Blood Sugar
* Pain assessment
* level of consciousness.

* Medication
* SmokedCigarettes

* BedSore
* RoomTemperature
* Room humididy
